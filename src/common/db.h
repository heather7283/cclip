 *
 * Versions <=3.0.0 did not set user_version, so there's no way to reliably
 * detect schema version. However, this function will try to detect 'history'
 * table being present, and if it is, return 1 instead of 0. Additionally, if
 * the 'tag' column is present as well, then 2 will be returned.
 *
 * So:
 * Empty, just created database: 0
 * Database created with cclip 3.0.0: 1
 * Database created with cclip 3.0.0-next (with tag column): 2
 * Database created with cclip >=3.1.0 (proper usage of user_version): >=3
